SharkFrenzy web app designed for sharing social events and interact with event-goers. It is a full‑stack web project combining a C# backend with a modern React + TypeScript (Vite) frontend, deployed to Azure. I built core services, a clean REST API, and a responsive UI, focusing on performance, code quality (ESLint + typed rules), and cloud deployment automation.

To test the email confirmation functionality, you can run the project locally from the EmailConfirmation branch. It didn't end up in production because of the Resend limitations.
